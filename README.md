# discord-quickcss

Discord-QuickCSS is a complilation of CSS snippets I've gathered to make my personal theme. If you find certain aspects of it interesting, give it a whirl, or fork it and only keep what you need.

## Installation

In order to use it, navigate to the Themes tab in settings and click on the "Online Themes" tab. Then, in the textbox, paste `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DomBom16/discord-quickcss/main/css.css` on a new line. After unfocusing from the textbox the theme should be applied.
